# TFG-TWA

In this repository, the pieces of code used to developed the TFG can be found. Therefore, three main notebooks can be found:

- PREPROCESSING: This notebook includes all the functions and steps used in the preprocessing stage as weel as the creation of the dataframe used in future ML and DL algorithms.
- ML notebook folder: This folder includes the code for both experiments regarding the ML algorithms and feature extraction
- DL notebook: In this notebook, the DL experiments developed in the TFG regarding LSTM and CNN-LSTM netowkrs can be overviewed.
